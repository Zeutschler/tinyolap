# TinyOlap Samples

The best way to explore the various **capabilities of TinyOlap** is to try out the provided samples. 
Let's start with the simplest example. But before we start, please ensure to install all requirements
mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.

## Tesla (beginner)

The Tesla database is very short, but already a fully fledged example of TinyOlap. With just a few lines of code 
we will create a complete solution to support [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) on his annual 
business planning and reporting task for his [Tesla business](https://www.tesla.com).

**Before looking at any code**, you should take a look at the visual result. Just run the 
 [/samples/tesla_web_demo.py](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/samples/tesla_web_demo.py) 
from within your IDE or console. Then click on the following link in your console output.

    INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Your browser should open, and you should see a randomly generated report from the Tesla database.
Just hit the **Next Random Report...** button over and over again, as fast as you can. That is 
something that TinyOlap can do for you.
