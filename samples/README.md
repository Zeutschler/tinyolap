# TinyOlap Samples

The best way to explore the various **capabilities of TinyOlap** is to try out the provided samples. 
Let's start with the simplest example. But before we start, please ensure to install all requirements
mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.

## The Tesla Sample (Beginners)

The Tesla database is very short, but already a fully fledged example of TinyOlap. With just a few lines of code 
we will create a complete solution to support [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) on his annual 
business planning and reporting task for his [Tesla business](https://www.tesla.com).

**Before looking at any code**, you should take a look at the visual result. Just run the 
 [/samples/tesla_web_demo.py](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/samples/tesla_web_demo.py) 
from within your IDE or console. Then click on the link provided on your console output.

Your browser should open, and you will (hopefully) see a randomly generated report from the **Tesla** database.
Just hit the **Next Random Report...** button over and over again, as fast as you can. Then you'll see already 
something that TinyOlap could do for you: a backend to render some reports or charts.

Now please move on to code that created the Tesla database you just saw in action: [samples/tesla.py ](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/samples/tesla.py).  


## The Tiny Sample (Beginner)

**Usage:** Open and/or run the script [...tinyolap/samples/tiny.py](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/samples/tiny.py)

### Purpose of the Tiny data model

The **Tiny** data model is a very small and simple demo database created with Python code.
It's contains just very small 5 dimensions and 1 cube that reflects some **sales** data.
The intended use is to showcase the **all the basic operations** to create and access a TinyOlap database by code.
It also shows how to create and print simple reports to the console with the build in **Slice** object.


## The Enterprise Sample (Advanced)

**Note:** Under active development. Subject to change...

**Usage:** Open and/or run the script [...tinyolap/samples/finance.py](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/samples/enterprise.py)

### Purpose of the Enterprise data model

The **Enterprise** sample is a more realistic example for financial planning, reporting and
forecasting using TinyOlap. The entire database is randomly generated by Python code and 
realistically represents the structure and data volume for a small company group.  
The Finance data model could already be suitable a template to implement financial 
planning for your company. We tagged is as **advanced** as the code that generates the
data model looks a bit weird and complex. The datamodel itself is still quite simple.

**Before looking at any code**, you should take a look at the visual result. Just run the 
 [/samples/enterprise_web_demo.py](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/samples/enterprise_web_demo.py) 
from within your IDE or console. Data generation might take a while. Then click on the link provided on your console output.

The **Enterprise** data model provides the following features, leveraging most of TinyOlap's capabilities:

- Sales figures by legal entities and products based on price and quantity.

- Profit and Loss statement, integrating all other plans.

- (coming soon) HR plan covering employees some attributes and their salaries. Segmented by legal entities.

- (coming soon) Production plan covering planned quantities, raw material costs and capacities.

- (coming soon) User management and access rights, so, e.g., the sales guy can look into the salary data
  and only the finance guy can see certain cost figures and EBIT. And the boss can see
  anything but is not allowed to change data.
