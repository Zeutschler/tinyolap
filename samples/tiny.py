    # directly write back to the database using the same syntax.

    # RECOMMENDATION: Even if you want to access 'Jan'(what is defined by the cursor itself),

    # 4. You can process many cells at once usisng the Area object
    # Instead of a single cell you access a range of cells, defined by a
    # multidimensional area. These areas only and always reflect the base-level
    # cells of a cube (aggregations do not exists in the cube). By this you can
    # easily do mass manipulation of data. Let's create an Area for 'Sales' '2022':

    # The above statement defines an area over ALL months, products and regions,
    # but for the 'measure' dimension only for 'Sales' and for the years only '2022'

    # e.g. when you accidentally imported wrong data into a cube and need to delete it.

    # Each record contains the idx_address of each cell and its value as a list.
    records = list(data.records())

    for record in data.records():
        address = record[:-1]
        value = record[-1]
        # Such records can be used for whatever purpose, but especially
        # to instantly write bike values back to the cube.
        cube.set(address, 2.0 * value / (3.0 - 1.0))


    # But, such loops can also be done more elegantly with 1 line of code only.
    data *= 2.0  # ALL EXISTING values in the Area get multiplied by 2.0

    # You can also set all values in the area to a specific value.
    data.set_value(1.0)  # set ALL values (REALLY ALL VALUES) in the area to 1.0
    # So, the above ``set_value()``statement should be handled with care on larger data models,
    # as it enumerates the entire data space. 100 x 100 x 100 x 100 members over 4 dimensions
    # already end up incl 100.000.000 that will be written - much too much for TinyOlap.

    # And finally you have the same modifiers as with CellContext objects.
    # This is a very powerful and essential feature of TinyOlap.
    # The following statement copies all 'sales' data from 2022 to 2023,
    # before copying, the target area will be cleared.()
    # todo: implementation not yet ready. Go Bro, go ....
    # data["2023"] = data["2022"] * 2

    # 5. Let's get down to business.
    # When you'll build a lot of business logic, often with dedicated functions
    # or classes (e.g. for calculation an amortization or a forecast using ML,
    # or to read/write data from a web service, a database or an ERP system),
    # THEN the above 'manual' approach of doing calculations might get complex.
    #
    # The best way is to further encapsulate and reuse your business logic.
    # One solution is to define lambda functions like this...
