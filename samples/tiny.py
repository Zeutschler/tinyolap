    d = cube.cell("2022", "Feb", "North", "trucks", "Sales")
    # ...or you can just 'shift' your cursor TEMPORARILY to another cell idx_address, by defining what should change.

    # forget about that.

    # Another advantage as this approach using indexing/slicing is the fact that you can
    # directly write back to the database using the same syntax.
    c["Feb"] = d * 2.0

    # RECOMMENDATION: Even if you want to access 'Jan'(what is defined by the cursor itself),
    #                 it is good practice to ALWAYS use slicers, even is you don need to.
    #                 This greatly improves the readability and consistency of your code.

        # to instantly write bike values back to the cube.
        cube.set(address, 2.0 * value / (3.0 - 1.0))

    # But such operations can also be done much more elegantly with just 1 line of code.
    area *= 2.0  # ALL EXISTING values in the Area get multiplied by 2.0

    # You can also set all values in the area to a specific value.
    area.set_value(1.0)  # set ALL values (REALLY ALL VALUES) in the area to 1.0
    # So, the above ``set_value()``statement should be handled with care on larger data models,
    # as it enumerates the entire data space. 100 x 100 x 100 x 100 member_defs over 4 dimensions
    # already end up incl 100.000.000 that will be written - much too much for TinyOlap.

    # And finally you have the same modifiers as with Cell objects.
    # This is a very powerful and essential feature of TinyOlap.
    # The following statement copies all 'sales' data from 2022 to 2023,
    # but before copying, the target area will be cleared.()
    area["2023"] = area["2022"] * 2

    # 5. More serious business logic
    # When you'll build a lot of business logic, often with dedicated functions
    # or classes (e.g. for calculation an amortization or a forecast using ML,
    # or to read/write data from a web service, a database or an ERP system),
    # THEN the above 'manual' approach of doing calculations might get hard to maintain.
    #
    # The best way is to further encapsulate and reuse your business logic.
    # One solution would be to define lambda functions like this...
    sport_cars_in_percent_of_total = lambda x: x / x["products:Total"] * 100.0
    # ... so you can reuse this function for whatever cell that belongs to a cube
    # that contains the 'product' dimension you throw in:
    cell = cube.cell("2022", "Jan", "North", "trucks", "Sales")
    # The following call would now return the percentage of 'trucks' vs. 'Total' products.
    kpi = sport_cars_in_percent_of_total(cell)
    # ...but the best solution would be to define and use a dedicated function.
    kpi = my_business_logic(cell)


def my_business_logic(x: Cell):  # Tip: if you define the type 'Cell' for x, then intellisense will be with you.
    if x["products:Total"]:
        return x / x["products:Total"] * 100.0
    return None
