# TinyOlap 

TinyOlap is a light-weight, client-side, model-driven, cell-oriented, multi-dimensional OLAP 
database for **planning, budgeting, reporting, analysis and many other purposes**. 
Although this sounds very complicated, TinyOlap is actually very easy to use and should 
be suitable for all levels of Python and database skills. Enjoy...

## Getting started
**To get started**, please visit the **TinyOlap documentation** at [https://tinyolap.com](https://tinyolap.com)

Or, for the curious, just clone this repo and check our introduction sample [/samples/tiny.py](https://github.com/Zeutschler/tinyolap/blob/main/samples/tiny.py).

## How To Set up A Simple Database
Let's try to build a data model to support the quarterly business planning process of a well-known owner 
of electric car manufacturing company. So, here's how Elon Musk is doing his business planning - allegedly!

    from tinyolap.database import Database

    @rule("sales", ["Deviation"])
    def deviation(c: Cell):
        return c["Actual"] - c["Plan"]
    
    @rule("sales", ["Deviation %"])
    def deviation_percent(c: Cell):
        if c["Plan"]:  # prevent potential division by zero errors
            return c["Deviation"] / c["Plan"]
        return None
    
    def main():
        # define your data space
        db = Database("tesla")
        cube = db.add_cube("sales", [
            db.add_dimension("datatypes").edit().add_member(
                ["Actual", "Plan", "Deviation", "Deviation %"]).commit(),
            db.add_dimension("years").edit().add_member(
                ["2021", "2022", "2023"]).commit(),
            db.add_dimension("periods").edit().add_member(
                "Year", ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"]).commit(),
            db.add_dimension("regions").edit().add_member(
                "Total", ["North", "South", "West", "East"]).commit(),
            db.add_dimension("products").edit().add_member(
                "Total", ["Model S", "Model 3", "Model X", "Model Y"]).commit()
        ])
        # add your custom business logic
        cube.register_rule(deviation)
        cube.register_rule(deviation_percent)


Now that our 5-dimensional database is setup, we can start to write data to and read data from the cube.
TinyOlap uses slicing syntax ``[dim1, dim2, ..., dimN]`` for simple but elegant cell access. 

    # Add some 'Plan' data
    cube["Plan", "2021", "Q1", "North", "Model S"] = 400.0  # write to a single cell
    # The Elon Musk way of planning - what a lazy boy ;-)
    # Note: the following 'True' argument will force writing the number 500.0
    #       to all years, periods, regions and products in one shot.
    #       If skipped or set to 'False' only the single existing value 400.0
    #       would be overwritten.
    cube["Plan"].set_value(500.0, True)  # this will write 3 x 4 x 4 x 4 = 192 values to the cube
    cube["Plan", "2023"] = cube["Plan", "2022"] * 1.50  # Elon is skyrocketing, 50% more for 2023

    # Add some 'Actual' data
    cube["Actual"].set_value(elons_random_number)  # really? Elon is going for a shortcut.

    # Let's check Elon"s performance
    v = cube["Actual", "2021", "Q1", "North", "Model S"]
    p = cube["Plan", "2023", "Year", "Total", "Total"]
    d = cube["Deviation", "2023", "Year", "Total", "Total"]
    dp = cube["Deviation %", "2023", "Year", "Total", "Total"]
    if console_output:
        print(f"Elon's CAGR performance in 2023 is {dp:.2%}. Congrats!")  # CAGR := compound annual growth rate

## Why Building An In-Memory Database In Plain Python? 
TinyOlap started as a by-product of a research project - we simply needed a super-light-weight MOLAP database 
to feed thousands of databases into a neuronal network for training it on how to do proper business planning. 
But there was no database that met our requirements, so I build one: **TinyOlap**

TinyOlap is also a reminiscence and homage to the early days of OLAP databases, where great products like 
Applix TM/1 or MIS Alea enabled business users to build expressive data models with dimension, cubes and complex 
business logic in just a few minutes our hours. Unfortunately, these products have grown up to complex and 
expensive client-server database technologies, all striving for the ultimate performance on mass data 
processing and high number of concurrent users - there is no small and cheap MOLAP database anymore.

In contrast, TinyOlap is intended to stay **free, simple and focussed** on 
client-side planning, budgeting, calculations and analysis purposes. TinyOlap provides sub-second 
response for most queries (see limitations below) and supports instant 
*dimensional modelling* - e.g., adding new members to dimensions or adding new calculations.
