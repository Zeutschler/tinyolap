# Resource Planning Layer for cloudbased iPaaS Architectures

***iPaaS can be delivered in three ways:***

- As a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's application.
- As a private service (software or appliance) behind a firewall.
- As software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.

The first public platform as a service was Zimki, launched by Fotango, a London-based company owned by Canon Europe. It was developed in 2005, had a beta launch in March 2006 and a public launch at EuroOSCON in 2006. Zimki was an end-to-end JavaScript platform for web application development and utility computing that removed the repetitive tasks of creating web applications and web services. Zimki automated all aspects of infrastructure and operations, from provisioning and setting up virtual servers, scaling, configuration, security and backups. Zimki introduced the tagline "Pre-Shaved Yaks" to describe the removal of all these repetitive tasks.
