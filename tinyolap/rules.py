class Rules:
    """Rules define custom calculation or business logic to be assigned to a cube.

    Rules consist two main components:
    * A trigger or pattern, defining the context for which the rule should be executed
    * A scope, defining to which level of data the rule should be applied.
      Either for base level cells, aggregated cells, all cells or on write back of values.
    * A function, defining the custom calculation or business logic. This can be any Python method or function.

    .. information::
        Rules functions have to be implemented as a simple Python function with just one single parameter and
        a return value. The single parameter should be called 'c' and will contain an TinyOlap CellContext, representing
        the current cell context the rule should be calculated for.

        What happens in a rule function, is up totally to the programmer. The value returned by rules function
        can either be a certain value (most often a numerical number, but can be anything) or one of the following
        constants which are directly available from within a cursor object.

        * **NONE** - Indicates that rules function was not able return a proper result (why ever).
        * **CONTINUE** - Indicates that either subsequent rules should continue and do the calculation work
           or that the cell value, either from a base-level or an aggregated cell, form the underlying cube should
           be used.
        * **ERROR** - Indicates that the rules functions run into an error. Such errors will be pushed up to initially
          calling cell request.

        Sample of a proper rule:

        .. code:: python

                quantity = c["quantity"]

                # ensure both values exist or are of the expected type (cell values can be anything)
                if quantity is float and sales is float:
                    if quantity != 0.0:
                        return sales / quantity
                    return "n.a."  # the developer decided to return some text, what is totally fine.
                return c.CONTINUE
