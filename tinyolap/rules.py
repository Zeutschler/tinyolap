    Defines the code injection strategy for individual rules.

    By default, TinyOlap rules reside and will be executed from with your custom code.
    This is preferable for a lot of situations, e.g. for development and debugging,
    or when your business logic require resources that can or should not become a part
    of a TinyOlap database, like calling other systems or systems. When a TinyOlap
    database is running in in-memory mode this is anyhow the only available option
    to provide business logic to a TinyOlap database.

    However, when you intend to hand over a TinyOlap database to someone else, or if
    you want to host it as a generic webservice, then your business logic ideally
    goes with the database.

    To enable this TinyOlap can automatically inject your rule source code into the
    database and persist it with the database. The next time the database will be opened,
    your code will be automatically instantiated and run from within the TinyOlap engine
    itself. You can at anytime override / replace these injected rules with your own
    code by calling  the ``add_rule(...)`` method provide by the *cube* class.

    There are 4 different strategies available how to inject rules into a TinyOlap
    database. Depending on your use case, you should try to use the most restrictive
    strategy possible, as explained below in the documentation of the different
    RuleInjectionStrategy enum values.

    Please be aware that code injection does work on actual code level, not on file level.
    If you have created dynamic code, the code should be properly extracted by TinyOlap.

    NO_INJECTION = 0  # doc: (default) Indicates that the rule should not be injected into the database.
    FUNCTION_INJECTION = 1  # doc: Indicates that **only** the rule function itself will be injected into the database. All surrounding code of the module or project where the rule function is defined, will be ignored. This requires your rule function to be **autonomous**. Meaning, without any dependencies to functions or classes from within your code. By default, TinyOlap will only reference the following built-in Python modules using the ``from [module name] import *`` trigger, when running your code: math, cmath, statistics, decimal, fractions, random, datetime, time, re, json. ``FUNCTION_INJECTION`` should be the preferred strategy for simple business logic that acts upon the data from a TinyOlap database only.
    MODULE_INJECTION = 2  # doc: Indicates that the **entire** module in which the rule function is defined will be injected doc: into the database. Code from other modules of your project will be ignored. If your rules are spread or multiple modules, all these modules will be injected. This requires that all modules and Python packages referenced from within your module must also be installed on the target system. TinyOlap will raise an appropriate error if the instantiation of your code module in the target environment will fail. ``MODULE_INJECTION`` should be the preferred strategy for more complex business logic or business logic that requires certain initialization (e.g. read exchange rates from a service)

class Rules:
    """Represemts a list of rules. Rules define custom calculations or business logic to be assigned to a cube.

    Rules consist two main components:

    * A trigger or trigger, defining the context for which the rule should be executed

    * A scope, defining to which level of data the rule should be applied.
      Either for base level cells, aggregated cells, all cells or on write back of values.

    * A function, defining the custom calculation or business logic. This can be any Python method or function.

    .. attention::

        Rules functions have to be implemented as a simple Python function with just one single parameter and
        a return value. The single parameter should be called 'c' and will contain an TinyOlap Cell, representing
        the current cell context the rule should be calculated for.

        What happens in a rule function, is up totally to the programmer. The value returned by rules function
        can either be a certain value (most often a numerical number, but can be anything) or one of the following
        constants which are directly available from within a cursor object.

        * **NONE** - Indicates that rules function was not able return a proper result (why ever).

        * **CONTINUE** - Indicates that either subsequent rules should continue and do the calculation work
           or that the cell value, either from a base-level or an aggregated cell, form the underlying cube should
           be used.

        * **ERROR** - Indicates that the rules functions run into an error. Such errors will be pushed up to initially
          calling cell request.
