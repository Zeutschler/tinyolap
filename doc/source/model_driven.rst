Model-driven OLAP
=================

The basic idea of TinyOlap is to create a multi-dimensional data model, made up one or more
:ref:`cubes <cubes>` which themself are defined by a set of 1 to 32 :ref:`dimensions <dimensions>`
and optionally some :ref:`business logic<formulas>` which altogether represents your business problem.
Once this is done, you can enter or import data to finally view and analyse that data.
