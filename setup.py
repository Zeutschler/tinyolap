DESCRIPTION = "TinyOlap: A multi-dimensional in-memory OLAP database in plain Python 3."
LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
TinyOlap is a minimal in-process in-memory multi-dimensional database with numerical aggregations 
and calculations in mind. First a multi-dimensional data model needs to be defined, consisting of 
cubes, dimensions, members, hierarchies etc. Afterwards additional calculation logic can be added 
through arbitrary Python code. Data access is cell-based or range-based. A minimal support for SQL 
in also provided. All calculations will be executed on the fly. Optionally, persistence is provided
through SQLite. TinyOlap is a byproduct of a research project, intended to mimic the behavior and 
capabilities of real-world MOLAP databases (e.g. IBM TM/1, SAP HANA or Jedox PALO) but with a super 
minimal footprint. TinyOlap is best suited for interactive planning, forecasting, simulation and 
general multidimensional numerical problems.   

TinyOlap is also quite handy as a more comfortable alternative to Pandas DataFrames when your data
is multidimensional, requires hierarchical aggregations or complex calculations.
